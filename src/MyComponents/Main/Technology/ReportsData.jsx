                Organizing information collected from the field into
                client-ready, valuable reports can be a difficult process.
                Traditional security reports like messy, handwritten Daily
                Activity Reports (DARs) and out-dated forms can make this
                process even harder. Silvertrac builds detailed reports
                automatically to reinforce the value that quality security
                services bring to a client’s operation.

                Daily Activity Reports (DARs) can pull activity that fits unique
