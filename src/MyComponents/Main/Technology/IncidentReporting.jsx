                Simple incident reporting helps better gauge guard performance &
                improve client relations. Incident reporting feature allows
                guards to add the most important information anytime from any
                site as conveniently as possible. Traditional pen & paper
                reporting makes producing a Daily Activity Report a hassle.

                We do not have to spend time chasing down information from
                guards instead we use it to resolve the issues at hand.
                Silvertrac’s intuitive mobile guard app is designed to make
                security report writing as easy as possible so the right people
                get the right alerts at the right time. Guards simply tap and
                send and Silvertrac will handle the rest. Report issues straight
                from the field - in real-time from any property - based on
                criteria that can be included in any report, like:

                Each incident is immediately available for review in the Issue
                Monitor. Reports can be filtered by property, issue type, guard,
                priority level, and more. This allows any Argus Security to
                easily create detailed and personalized reports that have
                everything needed to support client demands. Reports are
                automatically generated and ready to be delivered to clients,
                giving them everything they need to know in one bite-sized
                summary.
